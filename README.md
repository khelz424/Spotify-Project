STATEMENT

The data was a spotify songs excel workbook file. It included information about different songs, with the artists from each song starting from 1905. 
I focused on displaying visualisations about the Total Albums Released per Genre, Top 5 Played Artists per Genre, Top 5 songs per the top 3 artists overall, 
and the Top 5 Albums overall ith their respective artists. I filtered the analysis to only present information for 2018 and 2019 for each visual.

STEPS FOLLOWED
1. Loaded the data into PowerBI
2. I did not have to do any data cleaning as they were no errors,duplicates,nulls, or empty rows
3. Created a Calculated column for the date
   3.1. created a new table called Calendar
   3.2. Copied the date column and pasted it in the Calendar table
   3.3. Then I created a calculated column to showcase the dates from the first day of the month to the last day
